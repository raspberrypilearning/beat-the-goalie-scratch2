## Control the goalie

It's far too easy to score a goal! Let's allow a second player to try and save goals.

--- task ---

Click on your __Goalie__ sprite and add this code to change the goalie's x position when the left arrow is pressed.

change x by (-10)
```

Press the left arrow to test your new code. Your goalie should move to the left.

Use blocks similar to the ones above to make the __Goalie__ move to the right `when the right arrow key is pressed`{:class="blockevents"}.

Add blocks to your code so `when the right arrow key is pressed`{:class="block3events"}, the __Goalie's__ `x position is changed by 10`{:class="block3motion"}.

You will need these blocks:

```blocks
change x by (10)

```

Your code should look like this:
