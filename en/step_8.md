## Challenge: manual control
Instead of the ball moving left and right automatically, can you allow your player to control the ball with the `a` and `d` keys?

To do this youâ€™ll need to remove the code for moving the ball left and right.

```blocks
when green flag clicked
forever
	go to x:(-200) y:(-140)
	repeat until <key [space v] pressed?>
-		move (10) steps
-		if on edge, bounce
	end
	repeat (15)
		change y by (10)
	end
	if <touching [goalie v]> then
		play sound [rattle v]
		broadcast [save v]
	else
		play sound [cheer v]
		broadcast [goal v]
	end
end
```

You can then add code to move the ball when the keys are pressed. Here are some code blocks to help you:

```blocks
change x by (-5)

if <> then 
end

<key [a v] pressed>
```
