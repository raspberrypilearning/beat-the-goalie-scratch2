## Moving the football

Let's code the ball to move across the bottom of the stage.

Open the 'Beat the Goalie' Scratch starter project.

Open the [starter project](http://rpf.io/p/en/beat-the-goalie-scratch2-go){:target="_blank"} in the offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff){:target="_blank"}.

In the starter project, you should see a goal backdrop, a football and goalie sprite.

Click the green flag to test your code. What happens if you click the flag a second time? Can you fix the problem?

After the `green flag is clicked`{:class="blockevents"} the sprite will have to `go to`{:class="blockmotion"} back to the start.

You will need this block:

```blocks
go to x:(-200) y:(-140)
```

Your code should look like this:

![football sprite](images/football-sprite.png)

```blocks
when green flag clicked
+ go to x:(-200) y:(-140)
repeat until <key [space v] pressed?>
move (10) steps
if on edge, bounce
end
repeat (15)
change y by (10)
end
```
